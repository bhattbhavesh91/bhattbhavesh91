I'm a Data Scientist & I enjoy solving problems. I'm really fascinated by the research happening in the Data Science/ML space & I try my level best to keep up with the advances.

In my Data Science journey so far, 
* I have had the honor of becoming a Google Developer Expert (GDE) in Machine Learning 
* I have also been awarded the prestigious 40 Under 40 Data Scientist award by Analytics India Magazine in January 2020.

In order to give back to the community from which I learnt so much I started creating videos on YouTube & currently I have 2 YouTube channels with close to 230 videos, 1.5 Million views & 30k+ subscribers.

### Bhavesh Bhatt

I'm a Data Scientist & I enjoy solving problems. I'm really fascinated by the research happening in the Data Science/ML space & I try my level best to keep up with the advances.

In my Data Science journey so far, I have had the honor of becoming a Google Developer Expert (GDE) in Machine Learning & also being recognized as a 40 Under 40 Data Scientist.

In order to give back to the community from which I learnt so much I started creating videos on YouTube & currently I have 2 YouTube channels with close to 200 videos, 1.2 Million views & 26k+ subscribers.
